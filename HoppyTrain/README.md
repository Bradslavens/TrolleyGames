# Word Flyer Game

A browser-based game inspired by Flappy Bird, where the player must fly through the correct word box to score points. The game is implemented in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no backend.

## How to Play
- Press **Start Game** to begin.
- Use the **spacebar**, **mouse click**, or **touch** to make the player (yellow circle) flap upwards.
- Three word boxes scroll from right to left. Only one contains a correct word; the others are incorrect.
- Fly through the correct word box to score a point. Hitting a wrong word or missing the correct word ends the game.
- The boxes fill the vertical space and are always connected.

## Features
- Responsive controls (keyboard, mouse, touch)
